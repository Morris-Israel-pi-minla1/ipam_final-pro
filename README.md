## ABSTRACT
Access to timely first aid information and emergency response services remains a major challenge in Sierra Leone, particularly during medical emergencies, accidents, fires, and mental health crises. Many individuals lack basic first aid knowledge and are unable to quickly access emergency contact numbers when needed.

This project presents the design and development of **First Aid Lite**, a mobile application developed to provide immediate first aid guidance and quick access to emergency services such as ambulance, fire force, and mental health support. The application is built using Flutter technology and is designed to operate efficiently on Android devices, with offline support for critical first aid instructions.

The Agile System Development Life Cycle was adopted in the development of the application. The results show that First Aid Lite is a practical and user-friendly solution that can significantly improve emergency preparedness and response in Sierra Leone.

# CHAPTER ONE – INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Background of the Study
First aid is the immediate assistance given to a person suffering from a sudden illness or injury before professional medical help arrives. In Sierra Leone, limited access to emergency medical services and lack of public awareness often result in preventable deaths.

With the growth of mobile technology, smartphones can be used to deliver health-related information quickly and efficiently. However, few localized first aid applications exist for the Sierra Leonean context. First Aid Lite was developed to bridge this gap.

## 1.2 Statement of the Problem
Many emergency situations in Sierra Leone escalate due to delayed response and lack of basic first aid knowledge. Emergency contact numbers are not readily accessible during crises, increasing the risk of severe injury or death.

## 1.3 Aim and Objectives of the Study
### Aim
To design and develop a mobile application that provides first aid guidance and quick access to emergency services.

### Objectives
- Provide step-by-step first aid instructions  
- Enable quick access to ambulance and fire force hotlines  
- Provide mental health and depression crisis support information  
- Ensure offline availability of critical first aid content  

## 1.4 Significance of the Study
The application helps reduce response time during emergencies and improves first aid awareness among the public.

## 1.5 Scope of the Study
The project focuses on an Android-based application designed for use in Sierra Leone. It supports emergency response but does not replace professional medical care.

# CHAPTER TWO – PROBLEM DEFINITION AND SYSTEM SCOPE

## 2.1 Problem Definition
Emergency response in Sierra Leone is challenged by limited resources, delayed communication, and lack of public first aid knowledge. Existing solutions are either not localized or require constant internet access.

## 2.2 Objectives of the Proposed System
- Provide accurate and simple first aid guidance  
- Enable one-tap emergency calls  
- Reduce panic during emergencies  
- Work with or without internet access  

## 2.3 Scope of the Proposed System
- Android mobile application  
- Offline first aid guidelines  
- Emergency call integration  
- User-friendly interface  

## 2.4 Limitations
- Requires a mobile device and battery power  
- Depends on availability of emergency services  
- Does not provide medical diagnosis  

## 2.5 Justification
The system provides a cost-effective, scalable solution for improving emergency preparedness using mobile technology.

# CHAPTER THREE – LITERATURE REVIEW AND METHODOLOGY

## 3.1 Concept of First Aid
First aid reduces injury severity and saves lives by providing immediate care before professional help arrives.

## 3.2 Emergency Response Systems
Emergency systems involve coordinated services such as ambulances and fire forces, which often face delays in developing countries.

## 3.3 Mobile Health (mHealth) Applications
mHealth applications improve access to health information and support emergency response, especially in low-resource environments.

## 3.4 Review of Related Systems
Existing first aid apps are effective but often not localized or offline-capable. First Aid Lite addresses these gaps.

## 3.5 Methodology
The Agile Software Development Life Cycle was adopted due to its flexibility and user-centered approach.
